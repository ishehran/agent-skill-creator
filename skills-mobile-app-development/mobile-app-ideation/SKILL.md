# Mobile App Ideation

Convert broad ideas into clear, testable mobile product opportunities before implementation.

## Default Mode: Problem-First (No Fixed Stack)

Focus on user behavior and context of use.

Do not lock React Native, Flutter, or native stacks during ideation unless constraints are already fixed.

## STOP: Before Build Work

Define these first:
1. Target segment and usage context
2. High-frequency workflow pain
3. Current alternatives and gaps
4. One-sentence value proposition
5. MVP scope and explicit exclusions
6. Activation and retention metric targets
7. Validation experiment plan and timeline
8. Go/no-go threshold

If unclear, continue ideation.

## Reference Files

| When working on... | Read first |
|---|---|
| Problem definition and context | `references/problem-framing.md` |
| Prioritizing ideas and bets | `references/opportunity-scoring.md` |
| Build handoff output | `references/solution-brief-template.md` |

## Workflow

1. Capture idea in one sentence.
2. Reframe as a user problem with context.
3. Select one primary segment for v1.
4. Score opportunity and feasibility.
5. Define MVP boundary and validation plan.
6. Decide go, pivot, or stop with measurable criteria.

## Non-Negotiables

- Keep problem and solution assumptions separate.
- Pick one primary segment for v1.
- Define success metric before experiments.
- Document "not in v1" explicitly.
- Make decision criteria measurable.

## Handoff Rule

When decision is go:
1. Fill `references/solution-brief-template.md`.
2. Continue with `../mobile-app-builder/SKILL.md`.

## Remember

Mobile success depends on repeated value in real usage context, not feature volume.
