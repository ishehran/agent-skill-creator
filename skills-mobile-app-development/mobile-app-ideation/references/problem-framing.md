# Problem Framing

Use this before deciding features.

## Core Questions

1. Who has the problem?
2. In which mobile context does it happen?
3. How often does it occur?
4. What is the user cost of failure?
5. What workaround is used today?
6. Why is current behavior not enough?

## Problem Statement Pattern

`[User segment] struggles to [job-to-be-done] in [mobile context], causing [cost], because [constraint].`

## Evidence Ladder

- Weak: assumption only
- Medium: repeated interview signal
- Strong: repeated pain + observed workaround + willingness to adopt

Do not move to build mode on weak evidence.
