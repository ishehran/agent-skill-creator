# Opportunity Scoring

Use consistent scoring to choose which idea to test first.

## Dimensions (1 to 5)

- Pain intensity
- Pain frequency
- Reachability of first users
- Differentiation potential
- Delivery feasibility
- Monetization clarity

## Weighted Formula

`score = (pain_intensity * 2) + (pain_frequency * 2) + reachability + differentiation + (delivery_feasibility * 2) + monetization`

## Decision Bands

- 24 or higher: test now
- 18 to 23: test if strategic fit is strong
- below 18: park until new evidence appears
