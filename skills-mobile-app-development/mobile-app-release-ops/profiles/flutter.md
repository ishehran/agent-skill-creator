# Flutter Release Profile

Use this profile when the app uses Flutter with iOS and Android outputs.

## Focus Areas

- deterministic build and signing outputs
- plugin compatibility and platform-specific checks
- staged rollout with crash and performance gates
- app startup and rendering health on device tiers

Apply with core release controls from `../SKILL.md`.
