# Incident Response Mobile

Plan mitigation before release starts.

## Incident Trigger Examples

- critical payment/auth flow breaks
- severe battery/performance regression

## Response Actions

1. Halt rollout progression.
2. Activate mitigation path (feature flag, config change, rollback).
3. Communicate status and impact.
4. Verify recovery metrics.
5. Document post-incident learnings.
