# Architecture Decisions

Choose architecture from journey and lifecycle constraints.

## Core Decisions

1. Navigation and feature boundary model
2. State ownership and caching model
3. Domain and IO adapter boundaries
4. Background work strategy
5. Error handling and retry policy

Keep dependencies pointed toward stable domain rules.
