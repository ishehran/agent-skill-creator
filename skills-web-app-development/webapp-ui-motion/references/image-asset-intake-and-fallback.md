# Image Asset Intake And Fallback

Use this when implementing UI from screenshots or inspiration references.

## Core Rule

Reference screenshots are guidance, not source assets.

Do not crop objects out of screenshots for final UI.

## Asset Intake Checklist

Request these from the user when relevant:
- logo files (prefer SVG)
- hero/product images (PNG/JPG/WebP)
- icon pack or design system icons
- illustration files
- sequence frames for motion/animated imagery

Also confirm:
- usage rights and ownership
- preferred formats and target dimensions
- transparent background requirements

## If Assets Are Missing

Fallback in this order:
1. user-approved placeholders
2. licensed stock/open assets matching style
3. generated temporary assets with explicit replacement note

Always label temporary assets and request final replacements before release.

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing:
1. verify no screenshot fragments are used as production assets
2. verify assets are responsive and not stretched/distorted
3. verify alt text and accessibility labels where needed
4. verify licensing/ownership assumptions are documented
