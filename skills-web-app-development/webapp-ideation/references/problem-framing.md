# Problem Framing

Use this before selecting features.

## Core Questions

1. Who has the problem?
2. What workflow breaks?
3. How often does it happen?
4. What is the cost of not solving it?
5. What do users do today instead?
6. Why are current alternatives insufficient?

## Good Problem Statement Pattern

`[User segment] struggles to [job-to-be-done] in [context], causing [cost/risk], because [root constraint].`

Example shape:
`Independent insurance agents struggle to track quote follow-ups across channels during busy weeks, causing missed renewals, because updates are fragmented across tools.`

## Evidence Ladder

- Weak: personal intuition only
- Medium: 3 to 5 conversations with repeated pain signal
- Strong: repeated pain + observed workaround behavior + willingness to change/pay

Do not move to build mode on weak evidence.
