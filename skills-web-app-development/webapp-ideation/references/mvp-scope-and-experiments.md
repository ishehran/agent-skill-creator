# MVP Scope And Experiments

Define what to build and how to validate it with minimum waste.

## MVP Scope Rules

Include only features needed to:
1. deliver the core user outcome once
2. prove adoption signal
3. support safe operations at basic level

Explicitly write "not in v1" items.

## Experiment Types

- Interview test: verify pain and language with target users.
- Landing page test: validate interest and messaging.
- Concierge test: deliver value manually before full automation.
- Clickable prototype test: validate workflow and usability.
- Pilot release: validate activation and repeat usage.

## Select By Risk

- Problem uncertainty high -> interviews first
- Value proposition uncertainty high -> landing/prototype test
- Workflow uncertainty high -> concierge/prototype
- Retention uncertainty high -> limited pilot

## Go/No-Go Example Thresholds

- At least 40 percent of interviews confirm same high pain
- At least 20 percent qualified visitors complete call-to-action
- At least 60 percent pilot users finish the core journey once

Adjust thresholds by market and product type, but define them before test execution.
