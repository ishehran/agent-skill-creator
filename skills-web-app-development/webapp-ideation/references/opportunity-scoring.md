# Opportunity Scoring

Score each idea quickly so decisions are consistent.

## Scoring Dimensions (1 to 5)

- Pain intensity: how painful is the current state?
- Pain frequency: how often does the problem occur?
- Reachability: how easily can the first segment be reached?
- Differentiation potential: can this be meaningfully better?
- Delivery feasibility: can v1 ship in a short cycle?
- Monetization clarity: is there a clear value capture path?

## Weighted Formula

`score = (pain_intensity * 2) + (pain_frequency * 2) + reachability + differentiation + (delivery_feasibility * 2) + monetization`

Higher score does not guarantee success, but helps prioritize where to test first.

## Decision Bands

- 24+: test immediately
- 18 to 23: test if strategic fit is strong
- below 18: park unless new evidence appears
