# Requirements-First Template

Use this short brief before making stack or implementation decisions.

## 1) Problem and User

- Who is the user?
- What problem are they facing?
- What outcome should improve?

## 2) Critical Journey

Describe one core flow:
- start state
- user actions
- success state

## 3) Must-Haves (V1 Only)

List only non-negotiable capabilities for first release.

## 4) Data and Sensitivity

- what data is collected/stored
- sensitivity level (low, medium, high)
- retention or compliance needs

## 5) Integrations

List external systems (payments, email, AI APIs, auth providers, etc.).

## 6) Non-Functional Requirements

- target performance (response time, throughput)
- reliability target (availability/SLO)
- security/compliance level

## 7) Delivery Constraints

- timeline
- budget/hosting constraints
- team/operator constraints

## 8) Success Metric

How success is measured (activation rate, conversion, task completion, cost savings, etc.).

## 9) Stack Selection Note (After Requirements)

After sections 1-8, select a stack and record:
- why this stack fits the constraints
- key tradeoffs accepted
- what would trigger a future stack change
