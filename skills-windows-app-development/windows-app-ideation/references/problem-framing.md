# Problem Framing

Use this before selecting features.

## Core Questions

1. Who has the problem?
2. Which desktop workflow breaks?
3. How often does this happen?
4. What is the time, money, or risk cost?
5. What tool is used today?
6. Why is current behavior not good enough?

## Problem Statement Pattern

`[User segment] struggles to [job-to-be-done] in [context], causing [cost], because [constraint].`

## Evidence Ladder

- Weak: intuition only
- Medium: repeated interview signal
- Strong: repeated pain + visible workaround + willingness to change

Do not enter build mode on weak evidence.
