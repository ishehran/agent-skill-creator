# WinUI .NET Deployment Profile

Use this profile when the app is .NET desktop (WinUI/WPF) with MSIX or installer-based distribution.

## Focus Areas

- .NET build reproducibility and artifact signing
- installer/update validation across supported Windows versions
- startup and crash telemetry integration
- staged rollout with ring-based deployment

Apply with core release controls from `../SKILL.md`.
