# 🌍 Agent Skills

Welcome to **Agent Skills Creator** 🚀  
This is a public repo for reusable **agent skills** that help you go from idea -> shipped product faster.

## 🧠 What this project is

Think of this repo like a skill library for AI-assisted building.

Each skill gives you:
- clear steps
- guardrails
- references
- practical workflows

So instead of writing random prompts every time, you get a repeatable system.

## 🤖 Model-agnostic by design (I use them for codex)

You can use these skills with **any coding AI model** or LLM assistant.

This repo is not locked to one tool.  
Use whatever model works best for you.

## 👾 For Vibe coders

If you are idea-first and not deeply technical, this repo is for you.

You focus on:
- ideas
- product direction
- user value

Your chosen AI assistant can handle:
- architecture
- implementation flow
- testing strategy
- deployment and release planning

## 📦 What's inside right now

Current skill suites:
- 🌐 `skills-web-app-development`
- 🎮 `skills-2d-game-development`
- 🪟 `skills-windows-app-development`
- 📱 `skills-mobile-app-development`

Most suites include:
- ideation
- builder
- testing
- deployment/release ops

## ⚙️ How to use these agent skills

Simple version:
1. Copy the skill folder(s) you want into your project.
2. Tell your AI assistant to read those `SKILL.md` files.
3. Ask it to use them whenever relevant.
4. Build in small steps and keep iterating.

Prompt example you can paste:
`Read the skills in ./skills-web-app-development and follow them as default guidance for this task.`

## ✅ What you get from this

- clearer decisions
- less trial and error
- faster shipping with fewer blind spots
- better quality and release confidence
- reusable playbooks for future projects

## 🔮 What's coming next

This repo is actively growing.  
More skills, more profiles, and more real-world examples are coming.

This is not limited to the current four suites.

## 🤝 Final note

Build bold ideas.  
Keep the process simple.  
Let the skills handle structure while you stay creative.
