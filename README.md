# 🌍 Global README

Welcome to **Agent Skills Creator** 🚀  
This is a public repo for building reusable **Codex skills** that help you go from idea -> shipped product faster.

## 🧠 What this project is

Think of this repo like a **skill library** for AI-assisted builders.

Each skill gives you:
- clear steps
- guardrails

So instead of asking random prompts every time, you get a **repeatable system**.
