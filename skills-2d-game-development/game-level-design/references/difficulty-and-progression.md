# Difficulty And Progression

Use explicit progression targets instead of ad-hoc tuning.

## Difficulty Budget

Assign each level a budget from 1 to 10.

Budget is influenced by:
- execution precision required
- decision speed required
- punishment for mistakes
- amount of new information introduced

Keep adjacent levels within a small delta unless the game intentionally pivots.

## Progression Rules

- Introduce one new mechanic at a time.
- Give one low-risk practice segment before first high-risk test.
- Combine mechanics only after each is stable individually.
- Reserve hard spikes for optional or late-game content unless genre requires otherwise.

## Checkpoint Heuristic

Higher risk sections should have shorter repeat distance after failure.

If failure replay time exceeds learning value, checkpoint spacing is too long.
