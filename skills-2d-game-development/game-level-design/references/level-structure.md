# Level Structure

Structure each level as intentional sections instead of one long obstacle chain.

## Section Pattern

Use this sequence for most levels:
1. Onboarding section: safe introduction of mechanic
2. Reinforcement section: repeated use under mild pressure
3. Combination section: mechanic plus prior knowledge
4. Mastery section: higher pressure with fair recovery options
5. Exit or reward section: short decompression and payoff

## Design Checks

- Is the objective clear within first 10 to 20 seconds?
- Can the player predict danger from visual cues?
- Are safe spots available for planning in hard segments?
- Is route length between checkpoints appropriate?

## Encounter Density Rule

Increase one variable at a time:
- enemy count
- hazard timing
- movement precision
- resource scarcity

Avoid increasing all variables in the same step.
